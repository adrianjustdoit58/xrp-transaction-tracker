# Tasks for XRP Transaction Tracker

## Active Tasks
- [2024-10-12] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud: Push to GitHub and host the app for web access with login.

## Completed Tasks
- [2024-10-12] Finalize project for forensic use: Add PDF reports, login, docs, and deploy to web. (Completed: 2024-10-12)
- [2024-10-12] Implement shared tagging DB: Use SQLite for persistent storage of tags, allowing easy sharing and updates. (Completed: 2024-10-12)
- [2024-10-12] Implement Streamlit UI: Create app.py for interactive transaction tracing and visualization. (Completed: 2024-10-12)
- [2024-08-02] Add unit tests: Implement pytest tests for tracing and heuristics functions. (Completed: 2024-10-12)
- [2024-08-02] Research and implement initial XRP heuristics: Adapt clustering and mixer detection for account model, integrate into tracing logic. (Completed: Basic mixer detection and clustering notes added; tested with example, though API returned 404.)
- [2024-08-01] Test MVP with user's example transaction path: Use provided addresses (e.g., rHy0Hc3G9DuK as intermediate) to validate tracing, add any detected mixers/exchanges to known list, and generate graph. (Completed: Retested with new data; traced path successfully, graph generated, no alerts in this segment.)

## Discovered During Work
- Use 'python3' instead of 'python' on macOS to run scripts.
- Addresses in screenshots are partial; used visible full one for testing.
- Example addresses may return 404 if inactive; need real test data for full validation.
